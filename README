Oxref generates a cross reference listing of symbols defined in non-stripped
object files and/or libraries.

A cross reference listing shows the functions using certain symbols
(functions, data).  This is useful information during program develop- ment
and debugging phases.  E.g., assuming that the signature; the pre-conditions
or the post-conditions of a function must be changed it is important to know
from what function(s) the function-to-modify is called to verify that the
changes to the modified function do not break its calling functions.

The generated cross reference listing starts with a header showing information
about the program, a time stamp and the arguments passed to oxref. E.g.,


To create the program from its sources, either descend into the oxref
directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory and
follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.

Alternatively, binary ready-to-install versions of oxref are available in
verious Linux distributions, in particular Debian. See, e.g.,
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=oxref&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
