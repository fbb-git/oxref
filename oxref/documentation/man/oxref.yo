manpagedescription()

    The program bf(oxref) generates a cross reference listing of symbols
defined in non-stripped object files and/or libraries. 

    A cross reference listing shows the functions using certain symbols
(functions, data). This is useful information during program development and
debugging phases. E.g., assuming that the signature; the pre-conditions or the
post-conditions of a function must be changed it is important to know from what
function(s) the function-to-modify is called to verify that the changes to the
modified function do not break its calling functions.

The generated cross reference listing starts with a header showing information
about the program, a time stamp and the arguments passed to tt(oxref). E.g.,

manpagesection(RETURN VALUE)

    bf(Oxref) returns 0 to the operating system unless an error occurs or
bf(oxref)'s version or usage info is shown or requested. In those cases 1 is
returned 

manpageoptions()

    If available, single letter options are listed between parentheses
following their associated long-option variants. Single letter options require
arguments if their associated long options require arguments as well.
    itemization(
    it() lsoption(arg)(a)(mode)nl()
        Mode specifies the way the output is abbreviated:nl()

        bf(count) - function parameters are suppressed; instead the number of
arguments required by a function is shown in its parameter list. Example:
        verb(
usage(1)
        )
    instead of
        verb(
usage(std::string const&)
        )

    bf(first) - only show the first word of parameters. Example:
        verb(
insertDefined(unsigned, std::ostream&, std::vector&)
        )
    instead of
        verb(
insertDefined(unsigned int, std::ostream&, std::vector<XrefData, 
              std::allocator<XrefData> > const&)
        )

        bf(<len>) - where tt(<len>) is a positive integral number (5 is used
if tt(<len>) is less than 5). tt(<len>) specifies the maximum length of
parameter names. If parameter names need to be truncated, an ellipsis replaces
the truncated characters. 
Example using tt(-a 12):
        verb(
insertDefined(unsigned int, std::ostream&, std::vect...&)
        )
    instead of
        verb(
insertDefined(unsigned int, std::ostream&, std::vector<XrefData, 
              std::allocator<XrefData> > const&)
        )

    it() loption(full-symbol) soption(f)nl()
        The full names of the symbols are shown, in addition to the plain
symbol names. Full names include class names and/or namespace
identifiers. Example: 
        verb(
insertDefined(unsigned int, std::ostream&, std::vector<XrefData,
              std::allocator<XrefData> > const&) 
  Full name: Store::insertDefined(unsigned int, std::ostream&,
          std::vector<XrefData, std::allocator<XrefData> > const&) 
        )

    it() loption(help) (soption(h))nl()
           Basic usage information is written to the standard error stream.

    it() loption(object-files) (soption(o))nl()
            Include the name of object files containing the symbols in the
        cross reference listing

    it() laoption(select)(name)nl()
            Only display the cross-reference of tt(name), where tt(name) 
        is the (case sensitive) initial substring of a symbol

    it() laoption(select-pattern)(regex)nl()
            Only display the cross-reference of symbols matching the regular
        expression tt(regex), where tt(regex) is a regular expression matching
        the bf(regex)(7) specification, including the extensions offered by 
        the bf(pattern)(3bobcat) bf(Pattern) class. Case sensitive matching is
        used here, too.

    it() loption(source-files) (soption(s))nl()
            Include the name of source files containing the symbols in the
        cross reference listing

    it() loption(xref-source-files) (soption(x))nl()
            Include the name of source files containing the used symbols in
        the cross reference listing

    it() loption(version) (soption(v))nl()
           tt(Oxref)'s version number is written to the standard error stream.

manpagesection(EXAMPLES)

    The examples show how tt(oxref) was called, followed by a representative
example of a cross-reference listing for a symbol. tt(Oxref)'s own cross
reference listing was used:
    verb(
called as: oxref liboxref

define(std::string const&, bool)
  Used By:
    Store::setFunction(std::string const&)
    Store::setObject(std::string const&)
    Store::setSource(std::string const&)

--------------------

called as: oxref -foxs liboxref

define(std::string const&, bool)
  Full name: Store::define(std::string const&, bool)
  Source:    define.cc (1define.o)
  Used By:
    setfunction.cc: Store::setFunction(std::string const&)
    setobject.cc: Store::setObject(std::string const&)
    setsource.cc: Store::setSource(std::string const&)
    )

manpagebugs()

    This is the initial release version of tt(oxref). 

manpagesection(ABOUT)


    In theory, creating cross reference listings is a complex matter as it
requires a full syntax analysis of the sources defining a program. Especially
with complex languages like bf(C++) this is a difficult hurdle to pass. 

    Looking for `cross reference programs' using a search engine returns
remarkably few hits. LXR is a promising cross referencing program (see
lurl(http://lxr.linux.no/)), but it requires the use of data base packages,
making it somewhat complex to use. Other links refer to cross-reference
programs for textual documents, not programs.

    The complexity of developing a program generating a 
cross reference listing has baffled me for a long time. Eventually I realized
that in practice the essential information has already been generated by the
compiler, when it compiles our source files. So why do it all again?

    Once a program has been compiled one or (usually) more object files are
available. The linker uses tables of defined and external symbols embedded
in the object files to connect the various functions. If all requirements can
be satisfied the linker is able to create a running program.

    Programs like bf(nm)(1) and bf(objdump)(1) can be used to produce human 
readable output from the information embedded in object files. tt(Oxref) reads
this information and organizes it, creating a cross reference listing.

    Since all compilable program languages generate identically organized
object files (or maybe better: generate object files that can be interpreted
by bf(objdump)(1)), tt(oxref) can broadly be applied. As long as
bf(objdump)(1) produces sensible output tt(oxref) should be able to generate a
cross reference listing.

    tt(Oxref)'s name consists of two syllables: tt(o) and tt(xref). The tt(o)
represents the program bf(objdump)(1), called from tt(oxref) as a child
program. The important part is of course the cross-referencing of
symbols. Like the common abbreviation of em(rail-road crossing), em(rail-road
xing), cross referencing is abbreviated to tt(xref). Hence tt(oxref). 

    Of course, nearly everybody will read tt(oxref) as
tt(ox-ref). Fortunately, here too we're on familiar ground: Bison, Cow, Gnu,
Yacc: all are bovine animals. To that important list tt(oxref) adds the Ox.

    An example of tt(oxref)'s own cross reference listing is provided (on
Debian systems) in the file
