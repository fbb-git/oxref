Preliminaries:
--------------

You need icmake to compile oxref yourself. Icmake may be obtained from
http://icmake.sourceforge.net/

If you don't have icmake, you have to compile and link all sources by hand.
No support for this case is provided here.

To construct the man-page you need Yodl. Yodl can be obtained from
http://yodl.sourceforge.net 

Both icmake and yodl are available as Debian linux packages, see
www.debian.org 

--------------

Oxref depends on the Bobcat library. Bobcat is found at
http://bobcat.sourceforge.net.

Bobcat is also available as Debian linux packages, see www.debian.org

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

1. All instructions should be done from the directory where
   the oxref_XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz archive unpacks to (i.e., oxref-XX.YY.ZZ/).
2. Make sure you have the bobcat library and headers installed
3. Verify (and optionally modify) the directory locations in INSTALL.im
4. Do (not necessarily as root)
        ./build program strip
    This creates the sripped tmp/bin/oxref program
    and 
        ./build man
    This creates tmp/man/oxref.1 and tmp/manhtml/oxrefman.html  
5. Do (as root)
    ./build install /
6. Read oxref's man-page for details about its use.

Cleanup-instructions.
---------------------

./build distclean should cleanup all files created during the construction
process of either program or man-page. Alternatively, remove the oxref-XX.YY.ZZ
directory extracted from oxref_XX.YY.ZZ.tar.gz
